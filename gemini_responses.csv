0,Medicine,What variables and cutoffs are used in the Alvarado score for suspected appendicitis?,direct,"The Alvarado score is a clinical tool used to help diagnose acute appendicitis. It assigns points based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results.

The variables and their corresponding point values are:
*   **Symptoms:** Migratory right lower quadrant pain (1 point), anorexia (1 point), and nausea/vomiting (1 point).
*   **Signs:** Tenderness in the right lower quadrant (2 points), rebound tenderness (1 point), and fever greater than 37.3°C (1 point).
*   **Laboratory Values:** Leukocytosis (white blood cell count > 10,000/mm³) (2 points) and a shift to the left of neutrophils (1 point).

The total score helps stratify patients by their likelihood of having appendicitis:
*   **Score of 0-3:** Low probability; appendicitis is unlikely.
*   **Score of 4-6:** Intermediate probability; further imaging like a CT scan is often recommended.
*   **Score of 7-10:** High probability; a surgical consultation is typically warranted.

A score of 5 or 6 is considered compatible with a diagnosis of appendicitis, while a score of 7 or 8 indicates a probable case, and a score of 9 or 10 suggests a very probable case of acute appendicitis.

0,Medicine,What variables and cutoffs are used in the Alvarado score for suspected appendicitis?,precise,"The Alvarado score is a 10-point clinical tool used to help diagnose acute appendicitis. The score is calculated using a combination of symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings, often remembered by the mnemonic MANTRELS.

The variables and their point values are:
*   **M**igration of pain to the right lower quadrant (1 point)
*   **A**norexia (loss of appetite) (1 point)
*   **N**ausea or vomiting (1 point)
*   **T**enderness in the right lower quadrant (2 points)
*   **R**ebound tenderness (1 point)
*   **E**levated temperature >37.3°C (99.1°F) (1 point)
*   **L**eukocytosis (white blood cell count >10,000/mm³) (2 points)
*   **S**hift to the left of neutrophils (1 point)

The total score helps stratify patients by risk. A score of 0-3 suggests appendicitis is unlikely. A score of 4-6 is considered equivocal, and imaging is often recommended. A score of 7 or higher indicates a high probability of appendicitis, and a surgical consultation is typically advised.
